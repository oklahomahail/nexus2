Brand Narrative:
Dallas LIFE is the longest residential recovery program in North Texas. For over 30 years, we've provided more than emergency shelter - we offer a complete pathway to transformation. Our four-phase, ten-month residential program addresses the root causes of homelessness: addiction, trauma, mental health, and broken relationships.

What makes us unique is our comprehensive approach. We're the only program in the region that provides private rooms for single fathers with their children, support for intact families, and specialized care for seniors. Our Teddy Cares program delivers trauma-informed services for children, breaking generational cycles of poverty and addiction.

We believe in the dignity of every person. Our residents aren't charity cases - they're men and women with God-given potential who deserve a real chance at lasting change. Through structured programming, vocational training, mental health support, and spiritual formation, we equip our residents with the tools they need to rebuild their lives.

The donor role is crucial. When you invest in Dallas LIFE, you're not just providing temporary relief - you're funding transformation. Your support keeps families together, helps men overcome addiction, and creates ripples of positive change throughout our community.

We tell stories of real people with real names, celebrating victories while respecting dignity. Every testimony is permission-based and focuses on the journey from struggle to hope to breakthrough.

Communication Guidelines:
- Use people-first language (person experiencing homelessness, not "homeless person")
- Focus on transformation, not tragedy
- Position donors as partners in restoration, not saviors
- Celebrate progress and milestones
- Be specific with impact metrics
- Use active voice
- Keep messaging hopeful and action-oriented
- Avoid victim narrative or pity-based appeals
- Highlight agency and dignity of those we serve

Visual Identity:
Primary colors reflect warmth, stability, and hope. Typography should be clean and professional. Photography should show real residents (with permission) in dignified, empowering contexts - working, learning, spending time with family, celebrating milestones.
