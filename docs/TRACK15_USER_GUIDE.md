```

#### Step 4: Design Your Narrative Arc

**What You'll Do:**

- Create 15 touchpoints across 5 stages

**Tips for Building Your Narrative Arc:**

## Viewing Analytics

### Accessing Track15 Analytics

**3 Ways to View Analytics:**

1. **From Sidebar:**
   - Click "Track15 Performance"
   - Select campaign from dropdown

2. **From Campaigns List:**
   - Click "Analytics" button next to Track15 campaign
   - Auto-selects that campaign

3. **Direct Link:**
   - Share URL with stakeholders
   - Includes campaign query parameter

### Analytics Dashboard

The Track15 Analytics dashboard shows **3 key metric sections**:

#### 1. Lift Metrics

**What It Shows:**
Comparison of Track15 methodology vs. control group (standard approach).

**Key Metrics:**

- **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of recipients who donated
  - Control: Baseline conversion
  - Track15: Enhanced conversion
  - Lift %: Improvement percentage

- **Revenue:** Total funds raised
  - Control: Expected revenue with standard approach
  - Track15: Actual revenue with Track15
  - Lift %: Revenue increase

**How to Interpret:**

```
✅ Good Performance:
- Conversion lift: 40%+
- Revenue lift: 45%+
- Consistent across both metrics

⚠️ Needs Attention:
- Conversion lift: 20-40%
- Revenue lift: 25-45%
- Misalignment between metrics

❌ Underperforming:
- Conversion lift: < 20%
- Revenue lift: < 25%
- Review narrative arc and messaging
```

**Example:**

```
Control Conversion: 3.2%
Track15 Conversion: 4.8%
Lift: 50%

Interpretation: Track15 methodology improved conversion by 50%,
meaning you got 1.5x more donors than standard approach would have
achieved.
```

#### 2. Segment Performance

**What It Shows:**
How each of the 7 donor segments responded to your campaign.

**Metrics Per Segment:**

- **Donor Count:** Number who gave
- **Total Gifts:** Sum of donations
- **Avg Gift Size:** Mean donation amount
- **Lift %:** Performance vs. expected

**Segments (Best to Worst Typical Performance):**

1. Champions (usually 50-60% lift)
2. Loyal (usually 40-50% lift)
3. Potential Loyalists (usually 35-45% lift)
4. New Donors (usually 25-35% lift)
5. Promising (usually 20-30% lift)
6. Need Attention (usually 15-25% lift)
7. At Risk (usually 10-20% lift)

**How to Use This Data:**

**Identify Top Performers:**

```
If "Champions" segment has 55% lift:
→ Your messaging resonates with loyal donors
→ Consider expanding investment in stewardship
→ Create dedicated Champions program
```

**Find Opportunities:**

```
If "At Risk" segment has only 8% lift:
→ Current messaging not reconnecting lapsed donors
→ May need different narrative arc for this group
→ Consider win-back campaign specific to this segment
```

**Optimize Budget:**

```
If "New Donors" has 40% lift but low donor count:
→ Great conversion, but small audience
→ Invest in acquisition to grow this segment
→ Track15 methodology works for conversion
```

#### 3. Retention Chart

**What It Shows:**
How many donors stay engaged across the 5 stages of the Track15 journey.

**Metrics:**

- **Donors:** Count at each stage
- **Retention Rate:** % who progress to next stage
- **Cumulative Revenue:** Total raised by this stage

**Stages (in order):**

1. Awareness (100% - everyone starts here)
2. Engagement (typically 70-85%)
3. Consideration (typically 50-70%)
4. Conversion (typically 35-50%)
5. Gratitude (typically 30-45%)

**How to Interpret:**

**Healthy Retention Pattern:**

```
Awareness → Engagement: 80%
Engagement → Consideration: 65%
Consideration → Conversion: 45%
Conversion → Gratitude: 40%

This shows gradual, expected attrition with strong
mid-stage engagement.
```

**Red Flags:**

```
⚠️ Big Drop at Awareness → Engagement (< 60%)
→ Opening touchpoints not compelling
→ Improve subject lines
→ Strengthen initial hook

⚠️ Big Drop at Consideration → Conversion (< 30%)
→ Donors interested but not converting
→ Reduce friction in giving process
→ Address objections more directly
→ Simplify donation form

⚠️ Low Gratitude retention (< 25%)
→ Donors not staying engaged post-gift
→ Strengthen thank-you messaging
→ Provide better impact updates
```

**Revenue Analysis:**

```
If revenue is flat between stages:
→ Donors giving early (good!)
→ But not capturing late-stage donors

If revenue spikes at Conversion:
→ Messaging working as designed
→ Donors waiting for direct ask (normal)

If revenue is distributed evenly:
→ Multiple touchpoints driving gifts
→ Consider which touchpoints to emphasize
```

## Best Practices

### Before You Start

**1. Complete Your Knowledge Base First**
Track15 campaigns are only as good as your foundational content:

- Brand guidelines inform visual consistency
- Voice & tone ensure messaging alignment
- Messaging pillars provide thematic backbone
- Impact stories fuel emotional connection
- Donor narratives guide segmentation strategy

**2. Set Realistic Goals**

```
Formula:
Historical Donor Count × Average Gift × Track15 Lift Factor (1.5)

Example:
500 donors × $150 avg gift × 1.5 = $112,500 goal
```

**3. Allow Adequate Prep Time**

- 2-3 weeks before campaign start
- Time for stakeholder review
- Buffer for revisions
- Email template setup
- Segment verification

### During Campaign Creation

**Writing Compelling Core Stories**

**Do:**

- Focus on impact, not your organization
- Use specific numbers and examples
- Paint vivid pictures with words
- Make the donor the hero
- Address head and heart

**Don't:**

- Use jargon or insider language
- Guilt or manipulate
- Make vague claims
- Focus solely on your needs
- Neglect proofreading

**Building Effective Narrative Arcs**

**Do:**

- Start with education, not asks
- Build trust before requesting money
- Vary your content types (story, data, testimonial)
- Create genuine urgency (not false scarcity)
- Always thank promptly

**Don't:**

- Ask for money in first 3 touchpoints
- Repeat the same message 15 times
- Ignore segment differences
- Create artificial deadlines
- Forget post-campaign gratitude

**Subject Line Best Practices**

**Strong Subject Lines:**

```
✅ "Meet Sarah: From food insecurity to stability"
✅ "The surprising truth about local hunger"
✅ "Your $50 = 7 days of groceries"
✅ "Only 48 hours left to reach our goal"
✅ "You did it! Final campaign results"
```

**Weak Subject Lines:**

```
❌ "Donate now"
❌ "Newsletter #3"
❌ "Important message"
❌ "Help us!"
❌ "Read this"
```

**Tips:**

- 6-10 words ideal
- Use numbers when relevant
- Create curiosity
- Personalize when possible
- Test with your team

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How is Track15 different from a regular campaign?**

A: Track15 uses a scientifically-designed 15-touchpoint narrative arc across 5 stages, with personalized messaging for 7 donor segments. Regular campaigns typically use 2-5 touchpoints with identical messaging for all donors.

**Q: Do I need to create separate campaigns for each donor segment?**

A: No. Track15 automatically customizes messaging for each segment within a single campaign. You build one narrative arc, and the system optimizes delivery.

**Q: Can I run multiple Track15 campaigns simultaneously?**

A: Yes, but we recommend spacing them at least 30 days apart to avoid donor fatigue. Exception: If campaigns target completely different donor segments.

**Q: How long does it take to create a Track15 campaign?**

A: Expect 2-4 hours for your first campaign (including learning time). Subsequent campaigns take 1-2 hours once you're familiar with the system.

### Campaign Creation

**Q: Can I save a draft and finish later?**

A: Yes. Your progress is automatically saved. You can exit the wizard anytime and return later. Find your draft in Campaigns → Track15 Campaigns.

**Q: What if I don't have content for all 15 touchpoints?**

A: We recommend completing all 15 for optimal results, but you can start with fewer. However, you must have at least one touchpoint in each of the 5 stages.

**Q: Can I change the campaign after launching?**

A: You can modify future touchpoints, but cannot change the campaign duration, season, or previously sent messages.

**Q: Do I need different narrative arcs for each segment?**

A: No. One narrative arc serves all segments. The system automatically adjusts tone, examples, and emphasis based on segment characteristics.

### Analytics

**Q: How often does analytics data update?**

A: Real-time for donations, hourly for segment performance, daily for lift calculations.

**Q: What does "lift" mean?**

A: Lift is the percentage improvement Track15 achieves compared to a control group using standard fundraising methods. 50% lift means Track15 raised 1.5x more than the baseline.

**Q: Why is my control group revenue lower than actual?**

A: The control group represents what you likely would have raised using traditional methods (based on historical data). Track15 revenue is your actual performance.

**Q: Can I compare multiple Track15 campaigns?**

A: Yes. Use the campaign selector dropdown in analytics to switch between campaigns. For side-by-side comparison, export data to Excel.

### Best Practices

**Q: When is the best time to run a Track15 campaign?**

A: Align with your selected season:

- Spring: March-May
- Summer: June-August
- Fall: September-November
- Year-End: December-January

Avoid major holidays (campaign should not span Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.).

**Q: How do I know if Track15 is working?**

A: Look for:

- Conversion lift >40%
- Revenue lift >45%
- Steady progression through stages
- Segment performance >30% on average
- Higher engagement metrics (opens, clicks)

**Q: What's the most common mistake?**

A: Asking for money too early. The first 3 touchpoints (Awareness stage) should educate and build trust, not request donations.

**Q: Should I tell donors this is a "Track15 campaign"?**

A: No. Track15 is a methodology for campaign design, not a brand. Donors simply experience a well-crafted, personalized fundraising journey.
